    "A Cepheid variable is a type of star that, due to some inherent instability, pulsates radially, varying in both diameter and temperature and producing changes in brightness with a well-defined stable period and amplitude. As it turns out, the period of pulsation and the Luminosity (i.e the absolute magnitude) of the Cephied are related. <br><br>\n",
    "We'll use data of cepheids from the Small Magallenic Cloud (SMC) obtained by a survey called Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE).The Small Magellanic Cloud is a dwarf galaxy satellite of the Milky Way, and distances to any star in it can be assumed to be almost constant. So the magnitudes translated directly into absolute magnitudes with some offset dependent on the distance to the SMC!"
